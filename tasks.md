# Tasks

**Physics Simulations**: Developing a visual 3D simulation of the experiment with semi-realistic physics.
 - Members: Christopher 
 - Status: Working with UE4
 
**Machine Learning**: Developing an algorithm to track particle velocities in a video.
 - Members: Patrick
 - Status: Working with http://site.physics.georgetown.edu/matlab/, https://web.stanford.edu/~nto/software_tracking.shtml. Or other alternatives.

**Radio**: Working with the UMD radio club to write software for the new ground station.
 - Members: Karen, Sam
 - Blocks: Weâ€™re waiting on some parts to be ordered from an approved SGA budget to start prototyping but we are meeting at 7 on Wednesday to study for the HAM radio licensing test so they could join us then and we can talk about ways to collaborate
 - Status: Research. Paper [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6880174), and others.
 - SRR deliverable: List of ground commands and their side effects on the cubesat

**Networking**: Data handling on the satellite and sending it down to the ground station.
 - Members: Kaitlyn
 - Status: Research. Read about software defined. Paper [here](https://www.wirelessinnovation.org/assets/documents/SoftwareDefinedRadio.pdf) and [here](https://cdn.rohde-schwarz.com/pws/dl_downloads/dl_common_library/dl_news_from_rs/182/n182_radiocomunit.pdf)

**Payload team**: Working with the payload team to develop the software that runs the experiment
 - Members: Amber, Andrew
 - Status: Set up linux VM. Read about controlling
 - Diagram of Cubesat dataflow


**Embedded programming**: Developing embedded software to control critical satellite components. Will run on a separate computer from the main software.
