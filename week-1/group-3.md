# Group 3

Members: Sahil Mayenkar, Chris Tharratt

This week we will be setting up our development environment and conducting research into various parts of the design. All groups will set up the same development environment, but will be doing different research. 

## Instructions
### Development Environment Setup
 - If you already have a linux environment you can skip this section (except the repo cloning)
 - Set up an [Ubuntu VM](https://ubuntu.com/) in [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). There are plenty of [tutorials](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/install-ubuntu-on-virtualbox-virtual-machine/) online explaining how to do this.
 - Clone this repository onto your VM. All our future code will go there. 
 - If you have issues with any of the above, message Chase on Slack. 

### Research
Group 3 will be researching *ground station research*. Our experiment won't be much use if we can't get the data back to earth. Thus, we need to communicate with a ground station. 

As a general guideline, we're interested in information like:
 - What hardware do CubeSats commonly use to communicate with ground stations?
 - Should we be interfacing with a ground station that already exists? Build our own ground station? Buy one? 
 - What wireless protocols or APIs are commonly used?
 - What are the bandwidth speeds like? Will transferring video files be difficult?

These are general guidelines, but use your own judgement to determine what you think the group needs to know. Don't spend an inordinate amount of time on this, we have a lot of time to pin down our design. If the dev environment setup takes people a while, we can push some of the research to next week.
