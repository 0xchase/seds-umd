# File Format

Contributors: 

If we process the images on the CubeSAT rather than sending the raw image data, we'll need a format to both serialize this data and send it to the ground. One promising canidate is JSON. The contributors for this project should develop a program to translate the CSV file to a JSON file.

Use Rust for this.
