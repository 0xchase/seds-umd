# Socket Programming

Contributors: Kaitlyn

When we implement our downlink communications protocol, we'll need to communicate over some sort of socket protocol. This task will provide a base for our future protocol code. 

Week 1: The task is to create code for a client and server. Have the server listen on a port, the client connect to the server, the client send a string like "hello world" over the network, and the server print this data to the terminal.

Week 2: Adjust this code to send/recieve a .json file
