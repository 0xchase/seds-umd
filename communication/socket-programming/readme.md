# Socket Programming

Contributors:

When we implement our downlink communications protocol, we'll need to communicate over some sort of socket protocol. This task will provide a base for our future protocol code. The task is to create code for a client and server. Have the server listen on a port, the client connect to the server, the client send a string like "hello world" over the network, and the server print this data to the terminal.

If you have little experienc networking, you may implement this in Python. Otherwise implement it in Rust.
