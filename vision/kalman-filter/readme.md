# Kalman Filter

Contributors:

If we decide to process the video on the CubeSAT, we'll need to track the particle locations in the video. One classic way to do this is with a Kalman Filter. The first weeks task will be to create a writeup, explaining how Kalman filters work, as well as their strengths and limitations. In future weeks we'll implement it in Rust or C++.
